            <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" > Solution to The Sad Fact About People's Lifetime Career Decisions </h2>
            <p>
                The fact of the matter is most people in the world stumble into careers through Trial and Error basis. 
                Finding one’s true Career Pathway does not have to be on luck, trial & error where people stumble into 
                studies and jobs that result in a lot of career frustrations where they lack passion, commitment and                 
                success in life. PNG’s Education System is totally FAILING innocent career potential students with NO 
                Curriculum & Assessment Designs to assess and track every child into Career Pathways. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-size: 20px;"> <b> Examination has always been mistaken for Assessment and Assessment for Examination. </b> </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; color: red; font-size: 20px;"> <b> Assessment will not take the place of Examination </b> </p>
            <p>
                Assessing and Identifying your Natural Talents and aligning them to your Learned Abilities to Maximize 
                your Full Potentials is worthwhile. The Career Assessments are part of Large Scale Assessment Systems. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Career Assessment Test Results provide you with LIFE TIME DECISIONS for your child’s future 
                career choices, family’s career decisions, solving social, marital issues and also to Recruit Key Talents 
                to engage people to jobs in organizations to be responsible and accountable in their performance in 
                ALL ASPECTS (interest, knowledge, skills, values) as they serve their passion with commitment & 
                dedication. <br>
            </p>
            <p> Your Learned Abilities (aptitude) are far less important compared to your Natural Interest and Passion </p>
